# react-native-cacheable-image
An Image component for React Native that will cache itself to disk. 

## Notes
CacheableImage understands its state. Once you define a source the first time it's state has been set. You can create another component with the same source and it will load the same cached file without having to fetch from a remote URI.

However, if you happen to change the source, the original cached file will be removed and a new cached image will be created. Basically, don't change the source once you've set it unless you need to. Create a new CacheableImage component and swap if you don't want the current image to be wiped from the cache.

This is beneficial in say you have a User Profile Image.  If the user changes their image, the current profile image will be removed from the cache and the new image will be saved to the cache. 

Local assets are not cached and are passed through. (ie, Default/Placeholder Images) 

This component has been tested with AWS CloudFront and as such only uses the path to the image to generate its hash. Any URL query params are ignored. 

Pull Requests for enhancing this component are welcome.
